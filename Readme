Forward proof search over rewrite rules. Tracks assumptions and rules applied, and searches over subexpression manipulation. Works, but is slow in some cases. Need to add backwards search.

proofsearch.hs  :  code for search
proofparse.hs   :  parse input strings into internal representation
prooftypes.hs   :  define types on Expressions and Rules for easy destructuring
prooftest.hs    :  a few test cases
